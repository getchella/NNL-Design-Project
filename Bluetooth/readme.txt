To use Bluetooth. Download the bluetooth file. From there you can just open "index.html" and use the interdace. Just click connect and it will ask for bluetooth devices to connect to.
  -Do not use firefox to open "index.html"
  -You may have to go into inspect the page *f12* and click disable javaScript, so that it is not checked off and problems should stop
  
 To alter these files, I recommend to use processing.exe: https://processing.org/download
